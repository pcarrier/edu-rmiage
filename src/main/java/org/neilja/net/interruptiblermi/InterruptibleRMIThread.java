/**
 * Extends Thread to provide support for interrupting the thread while the thread is in a blocking
 * RMI IO operation. Typically, threads that are in blocking IO operations can't be interrupted.
 * This implementation provides a mechanism for an RMI client socket (created by
 * {@link org.neilja.net.interruptiblermi.InterruptibleRMISocketFactory#createSocket(String, int)})
 * to register when it enters blocking IO. When {@link #interrupt()} is called on this thread, the
 * associated RMI socket is shutdown and closed, thus terminating the blocking IO operation. Use
 * {@link org.neilja.net.interruptiblermi.InterruptibleRMIThreadFactory#newThread(Runnable)}
 * to create instances of this thread class.
